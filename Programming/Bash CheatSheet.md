### commands usefull with servers

| command       | description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| scp /origin/file username@server.address.com:/path/to/destination | copy file/directory over ssh protocol
| scp -r /path/to/file username@server.address.com:/path/to/destination | to copy a folder to a remote server

* `diff -rq origin/folder dest/folder` | checks the difference in content between 2 folders
    * r : option to check folder recursivly
    * q : brief mode, not checking line by line the differences
* `rsync -avu --delete --exclude="/.*" /origin/folder/ /dest/folder` | sync the content of a folder with a folder by only adding the new elements. More details in [this section](##Details-for-commands)
    * `--delete` : deleting from destination what is not present in the source, /!\ dangerous /!\
    * `--exclude="/.*"` : excluding hidden files
    * `--dry-run` : only show what are the files that are planned to be sent without sending them

## File Permissions
`chmod [octal] [file]` 
changes the permissions of file to octal, which can be found separately for user (u), group (g), and world (o) by adding the following numbers or by specifying u, g or o and +(adding) or -(removing) and then the type of permision r, w or x instead of the octal (e.g. u+x for adding permission of execution to the user)

* 4 : read(r)
* 2 : write (w)
* 1 : execute (x)

`chown -<option> [new_owner] [file]`
change file owner and group

`ls -l <path>` shows the permission in the format `<file_type><user_permission><group_permision><world_permission>`
* fily_type
    * - : regular file
    * d : directory
    * l : symbolic link
* user_permission rwx

| `"$variable_name"` | to use the value of a variable in a command, use the variable name with a `$` in front of it
| command1 $(command2)    | to use the output of command2 in command1

## File globbing (named "simple pattern" in this CheatSheet)

Substitution characters interpreted by the shell to generate file names. It is not regex (Regular expression) !

## Applications

`&` added at the end of a command to open a GUI app lets you still access the terminal

vim file | opens file in vim terminal
xdg-open . | opens the default Linux file manager
matlab -nodisplay -r "matlab_commands" -logfile matlab_code.log
tmux new -s mysession | Start a new session with the name mysession
tmux a -t mysession | Attach to a session with the name mysession
tmus ls | list all the sessions



## Directory structure in linux

| directory     | description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| /             | is called the “root directory”
| /bin:         | contains binaries of basic commands
| /sbin:        | contains binaries of advanced commands (reserved to administrators)
| /etc:         | contains the configuration files
| /home:        | that's where users have their personal files
| /var:         | data generated by the system and its applications (mainly logfiles, databases,...)
| /tmp:         | contains temporary files, all users have write access


## Bash scripting
-----------------

To call a bash script with arguments arg1 and arg2 : `bash script.sh arg1 arg2`
```bash
arg1 = $1 # get the first argument of the script
arg2 = $2 # get the second argument of the script
num_args = $# # get the number of arguments
```

To use a command as a variable:
```bash
$(command)
```

To lauch a script in the background:
```bash
for i in {1..10} ; do
# Modify the filename
matlab_command="startup_server('DATA/examples/simple_geo01','simple_geo_${i}')"

# Call the MATLAB script using nohup
at now <<! 
matlab -nodisplay -r "${matlab_command}"
!

done
```

### Bash conditional expressions

```bash
if [condition1] ; then
    # code if condition1 is true
elif [condition2] ; then
    # code if condition2 is true
else
    # code if condition is false
fi
```

[condition] can be replaced either by an arithmetic expression between variables that has to be between double brackets `[[ condition ]]` (don't forget the spaces !!!)

| expression    | description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| -eq           | equal
| -ne           | not equal
| -lt           | less than
| -le           | less or equal
| -gt           | greater than
| -ge           | greater or equal


[codition] can also be replaced by the test command `test -[option] [target]`

| `-[option] [target]`  | description   |
| :-------------------- | :------------ |
| -f [file]             | file exists and is a regular file
| -d [file]             | file exists and is a directory




## Details for commands
----------------------

### `ls -<option> <path>`
List the content of the path with the option. The path is optional and it can be a simple pattern.

| option        | description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| l             | long format including permissions, owner, size, last modification, and the filename
| a             | all content
| R             | recursivly read all the contents of a directory (using tree is better)
| t             | time directory listing contents in chronological order of last modification
| S             | size of files order of listing
| h             | human readable file sizes (MB, GB, etc.)
| R             | recursivly read all the contents of a directory (using tree is better)
| 1            | list line by line


### `rsync -<option> <source_path> <destination_path>

| option        | description   |
| :------------ | :------------ |
| v             | verbose
| a             | archive mode (looking into directories, taking symlinks, permissions,...)
| u             | update (skip files that are newer on the receiver)
| h             | human-readable format for file sizes for instance
| i             | Requests a simple itemized list of the changes that are being made
              to each file, including attribute changes

**i option output string `YXcstpogz`**

* Y is replaced by the updated type
    * `<` means that a file is being transferred to the remote host (sent).
    * `>` means that a file is being transferred to the local host (received).
    * `c` means that a local change/creation is occurring for the item (such as the creation of a directory or the changing of a symlink, etc.).
    * `h` means that the item is a hard link to another item (requires --hard-links).
    * `.` means that the item is not being updated (though it might have attributes that are being modified).
* X stands for the file type
    * `f` for a file
    * `d` for a directory
    * `L` for a symlink
    * `D` for a device
    * `S` for a special file (e.g. named sockets and fifos).
* cstpogz stand for the reason of the update, 
    - if some reasons for update are not met, the letter are replaced by a `.`
    - if a newly created item, the letters are replaced with a "+", 
    - if an identical item exists, the letters are replaced with spaces\n
    * `c` means the checksum of the file is different and will be updated by the __file transfer__ (requires --checksum).
    * `s` means the size of the file is different and will be updated by the __file transfer__.
    * `t` means the modification time is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --times).  An alternate value of T means that the time will be set to the transfer time, which happens anytime a symlink is transferred, or when a file or device is transferred without --times.
    * `p` means the permissions are different and are being updated to the sender's value (requires --perms).
    * `o` means the owner is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --owner and super-user privileges).
    * `g` means the group is different and is being updated to the sender's value (requires --group and the authority to set the group).
    * `z` slot is reserved for future use.
