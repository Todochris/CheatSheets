# Pandoc's Markdown

Pandoc understands an extended and slightly revised version of John Gruber's [Markdown] syntax.  This document explains the syntax, noting differences from original Markdown. Except where noted, these differences can be suppressed by using the `markdown_strict` format instead of `markdown`. Extensions can be enabled or disabled to specify the behavior more granularly. They are described in the following. See also [Extensions] above, for extensions that work also on other formats.

## Philosophy

Markdown is designed to be easy to write, and, even more importantly, easy to read:

> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
> text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting
> instructions.
> -- [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)

This principle has guided pandoc's decisions in finding syntax for tables,
footnotes, and other extensions.

There is, however, one respect in which pandoc's aims are different from the
original aims of Markdown.  Whereas Markdown was originally designed with HTML
generation in mind, pandoc is designed for multiple output formats.  Thus, 
while pandoc allows the embedding of raw HTML, it discourages it, and provides
other, non-HTMLish ways of representing important document elements like 
definition lists, tables, mathematics, and footnotes.

## Paragraphs

A paragraph is one or more lines of text followed by one or more blank lines.
Newlines are treated as spaces, so you can reflow your paragraphs as you like.
If you need a hard line break, put two or more spaces at the end of a line.

#### Extension: `escaped_line_breaks` ####

A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.
Note:  in multiline and grid table cells, this is the only way
to create a hard line break, since trailing spaces in the cells
are ignored.

## Headings

There are two kinds of headings: Setext and ATX.

### Setext-style headings ###

A setext-style heading is a line of text "underlined" with a row of `=` signs
(for a level-one heading) or `-` signs (for a level-two heading):

    A level-one heading
    ===================

    A level-two heading
    -------------------

The heading text can contain inline formatting, such as emphasis (see
[Inline formatting], below).


### ATX-style headings ###

An ATX-style heading consists of one to six `#` signs and a line of
text, optionally followed by any number of `#` signs.  The number of
`#` signs at the beginning of the line is the heading level:

    ## A level-two heading

    ### A level-three heading ###

As with setext-style headings, the heading text can contain formatting:

    # A level-one heading with a [link](/url) and *emphasis*

#### Extension: `blank_before_header` ####

Original Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a heading.
Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at the beginning of the
document). The reason for the requirement is that it is all too easy for a
`#` to end up at the beginning of a line by accident (perhaps through line
wrapping). Consider, for example:

    I like several of their flavors of ice cream:
    #22, for example, and #5.

#### Extension: `space_in_atx_header` ####

Many Markdown implementations do not require a space between the
opening `#`s of an ATX heading and the heading text, so that
`#5 bolt` and `#hashtag` count as headings.  With this extension,
pandoc does require the space.

### Heading identifiers ###

See also the [`auto_identifiers`
extension](#extension-auto_identifiers) above.

#### Extension: `header_attributes` ####

Headings can be assigned attributes using this syntax at the end
of the line containing the heading text:

    {#identifier .class .class key=value key=value}

Thus, for example, the following headings will all be assigned the identifier
`foo`:

    # My heading {#foo}

    ## My heading ##    {#foo}

    My other heading   {#foo}
    ---------------

(This syntax is compatible with [PHP Markdown Extra].)

Note that although this syntax allows assignment of classes and key/value
attributes, writers generally don't use all of this information.  Identifiers,
classes, and key/value attributes are used in HTML and HTML-based formats such
as EPUB and slidy.  Identifiers are used for labels and link anchors in the
LaTeX, ConTeXt, Textile, Jira markup, and AsciiDoc writers.

Headings with the class `unnumbered` will not be numbered, even if
`--number-sections` is specified.  A single hyphen (`-`) in an attribute
context is equivalent to `.unnumbered`, and preferable in non-English
documents.  So,

    # My heading {-}

is just the same as

    # My heading {.unnumbered}

If the `unlisted` class is present in addition to `unnumbered`,
the heading will not be included in a table of contents.
(Currently this feature is only implemented for certain
formats: those based on LaTeX and HTML, PowerPoint, and RTF.)

#### Extension: `implicit_header_references` ####

Pandoc behaves as if reference links have been defined for each heading.
So, to link to a heading

    # Heading identifiers in HTML

you can simply write

    [Heading identifiers in HTML]

or

    [Heading identifiers in HTML][]

or

    [the section on heading identifiers][heading identifiers in
    HTML]

instead of giving the identifier explicitly:

    [Heading identifiers in HTML](#heading-identifiers-in-html)

If there are multiple headings with identical text, the corresponding
reference will link to the first one only, and you will need to use explicit
links to link to the others, as described above.

Like regular reference links, these references are case-insensitive.

Explicit link reference definitions always take priority over
implicit heading references.  So, in the following example, the
link will point to `bar`, not to `#foo`:

    # Foo

    [foo]: bar

    See [foo]

## Block quotations

Markdown uses email conventions for quoting blocks of text.
A block quotation is one or more paragraphs or other block elements
(such as lists or headings), with each line preceded by a `>` character
and an optional space. (The `>` need not start at the left margin, but
it should not be indented more than three spaces.)

    > This is a block quote. This
    > paragraph has two lines.
    >
    > 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
    > 2. Second item.

A "lazy" form, which requires the `>` character only on the first
line of each block, is also allowed:

    > This is a block quote. This
    paragraph has two lines.

    > 1. This is a list inside a block quote.
    2. Second item.

Among the block elements that can be contained in a block quote are
other block quotes. That is, block quotes can be nested:

    > This is a block quote.
    >
    > > A block quote within a block quote.

If the `>` character is followed by an optional space, that space
will be considered part of the block quote marker and not part of
the indentation of the contents.  Thus, to put an indented code
block in a block quote, you need five spaces after the `>`:

    >     code

#### Extension: `blank_before_blockquote` ####

Original Markdown syntax does not require a blank line before a
block quote.  Pandoc does require this (except, of course, at
the beginning of the document). The reason for the requirement
is that it is all too easy for a `>` to end up at the beginning
of a line by accident (perhaps through line wrapping). So,
unless the `markdown_strict` format is used, the following does
not produce a nested block quote in pandoc:

    > This is a block quote.
    >> Not nested, since `blank_before_blockquote` is enabled by default


## Verbatim (code) blocks

### Indented code blocks ###

A block of text indented four spaces (or one tab) is treated as verbatim
text: that is, special characters do not trigger special formatting,
and all spaces and line breaks are preserved.  For example,

        if (a > 3) {
          moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
        }

The initial (four space or one tab) indentation is not considered part
of the verbatim text, and is removed in the output.

Note: blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces.


### Fenced code blocks ###

#### Extension: `fenced_code_blocks` ####

In addition to standard indented code blocks, pandoc supports
*fenced* code blocks.  These begin with a row of three or more
tildes (`~`) and end with a row of tildes that must be at least as long as
the starting row. Everything between these lines is treated as code. No
indentation is necessary:

    ~~~~~~~
    if (a > 3) {
      moveShip(5 * gravity, DOWN);
    }
    ~~~~~~~

Like regular code blocks, fenced code blocks must be separated
from surrounding text by blank lines.

If the code itself contains a row of tildes or backticks, just use a longer
row of tildes or backticks at the start and end:

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    code including tildes
    ~~~~~~~~~~
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#### Extension: `backtick_code_blocks` ####

Same as `fenced_code_blocks`, but uses backticks (`` ` ``) instead of tildes
(`~`).

#### Extension: `fenced_code_attributes` ####

Optionally, you may attach attributes to fenced or backtick code block using
this syntax:

    ~~~~ {#mycode .haskell .numberLines startFrom="100"}
    qsort []     = []
    qsort (x:xs) = qsort (filter (< x) xs) ++ [x] ++
                   qsort (filter (>= x) xs)
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here `mycode` is an identifier, `haskell` and `numberLines` are
classes, and `startFrom` is an attribute with value `100`. Some
output formats can use this information to do syntax
highlighting. Currently, the only output formats that use this
information are HTML, LaTeX, Docx, Ms, and PowerPoint. If
highlighting is supported for your output format and language,
then the code block above will appear highlighted, with numbered
lines. (To see which languages are supported, type `pandoc
--list-highlight-languages`.) Otherwise, the code block above
will appear as follows:

    <pre id="mycode" class="haskell numberLines" startFrom="100">
      <code>
      ...
      </code>
    </pre>

The `numberLines` (or `number-lines`) class will cause the lines
of the code block to be numbered, starting with `1` or the value
of the `startFrom` attribute.  The `lineAnchors` (or
`line-anchors`) class will cause the lines to be clickable
anchors in HTML output.

A shortcut form can also be used for specifying the language of
the code block:

    ```haskell
    qsort [] = []
    ```

This is equivalent to:

    ``` {.haskell}
    qsort [] = []
    ```

This shortcut form may be combined with attributes:

    ```haskell {.numberLines}
    qsort [] = []
    ```

Which is equivalent to:

    ``` {.haskell .numberLines}
    qsort [] = []
    ```

If the `fenced_code_attributes` extension is disabled, but
input contains class attribute(s) for the code block, the first
class attribute will be printed after the opening fence as a bare
word.

To prevent all highlighting, use the `--no-highlight` flag.
To set the highlighting style, use `--highlight-style`.
For more information on highlighting, see [Syntax highlighting],
below.

## Line blocks

#### Extension: `line_blocks` ####

A line block is a sequence of lines beginning with a vertical bar (`|`)
followed by a space.  The division into lines will be preserved in
the output, as will any leading spaces; otherwise, the lines will
be formatted as Markdown.  This is useful for verse and addresses:

    | The limerick packs laughs anatomical
    | In space that is quite economical.
    |    But the good ones I've seen
    |    So seldom are clean
    | And the clean ones so seldom are comical

    | 200 Main St.
    | Berkeley, CA 94718

The lines can be hard-wrapped if needed, but the continuation
line must begin with a space.

    | The Right Honorable Most Venerable and Righteous Samuel L.
      Constable, Jr.
    | 200 Main St.
    | Berkeley, CA 94718

Inline formatting (such as emphasis) is allowed in the content
(though it can't cross line boundaries). Block-level formatting
(such as block quotes or lists) is not recognized.

This syntax is borrowed from [reStructuredText].

## Lists

### Bullet lists ###

A bullet list is a list of bulleted list items.  A bulleted list
item begins with a bullet (`*`, `+`, or `-`).  Here is a simple
example:

    * one
    * two
    * three

This will produce a "compact" list. If you want a "loose" list, in which
each item is formatted as a paragraph, put spaces between the items:

    * one

    * two

    * three

The bullets need not be flush with the left margin; they may be
indented one, two, or three spaces. The bullet must be followed
by whitespace.

List items look best if subsequent lines are flush with the first
line (after the bullet):

    * here is my first
      list item.
    * and my second.

But Markdown also allows a "lazy" format:

    * here is my first
    list item.
    * and my second.

### Block content in list items ###

A list item may contain multiple paragraphs and other block-level
content. However, subsequent paragraphs must be preceded by a blank line
and indented to line up with the first non-space content after
the list marker.

      * First paragraph.

        Continued.

      * Second paragraph. With a code block, which must be indented
        eight spaces:

            { code }

Exception: if the list marker is followed by an indented code
block, which must begin 5 spaces after the list marker, then
subsequent paragraphs must begin two columns after the last
character of the list marker:

    *     code

      continuation paragraph

List items may include other lists.  In this case the preceding blank
line is optional.  The nested list must be indented to line up with
the first non-space character after the list marker of the
containing list item.

    * fruits
      + apples
        - macintosh
        - red delicious
      + pears
      + peaches
    * vegetables
      + broccoli
      + chard

As noted above, Markdown allows you to write list items "lazily," instead of
indenting continuation lines. However, if there are multiple paragraphs or
other blocks in a list item, the first line of each must be indented.

    + A lazy, lazy, list
    item.

    + Another one; this looks
    bad but is legal.

        Second paragraph of second
    list item.

### Ordered lists ###

Ordered lists work just like bulleted lists, except that the items
begin with enumerators rather than bullets.

In original Markdown, enumerators are decimal numbers followed
by a period and a space.  The numbers themselves are ignored, so
there is no difference between this list:

    1.  one
    2.  two
    3.  three

and this one:

    5.  one
    7.  two
    1.  three

#### Extension: `fancy_lists` ####

Unlike original Markdown, pandoc allows ordered list items to be marked
with uppercase and lowercase letters and roman numerals, in addition to
Arabic numerals. List markers may be enclosed in parentheses or followed by a
single right-parenthesis or period. They must be separated from the
text that follows by at least one space, and, if the list marker is a
capital letter with a period, by at least two spaces.[^2]

[^2]:  The point of this rule is to ensure that normal paragraphs
    starting with people's initials, like

        B. Russell won a Nobel Prize (but not for "On Denoting").

    do not get treated as list items.

    This rule will not prevent

        (C) 2007 Joe Smith

    from being interpreted as a list item.  In this case, a backslash
    escape can be used:

        (C\) 2007 Joe Smith

The `fancy_lists` extension also allows '`#`' to be used as an
ordered list marker in place of a numeral:

    #. one
    #. two

Note:  the '`#`' ordered list marker doesn't work with `commonmark`.

#### Extension: `startnum` ####

Pandoc also pays attention to the type of list marker used, and to the
starting number, and both of these are preserved where possible in the
output format. Thus, the following yields a list with numbers followed
by a single parenthesis, starting with 9, and a sublist with lowercase
roman numerals:

     9)  Ninth
    10)  Tenth
    11)  Eleventh
           i. subone
          ii. subtwo
         iii. subthree

Pandoc will start a new list each time a different type of list
marker is used.  So, the following will create three lists:

    (2) Two
    (5) Three
    1.  Four
    *   Five

If default list markers are desired, use `#.`:

    #.  one
    #.  two
    #.  three

#### Extension: `task_lists` ####

Pandoc supports task lists, using the syntax of GitHub-Flavored Markdown.

    - [ ] an unchecked task list item
    - [x] checked item

### Definition lists ###

#### Extension: `definition_lists` ####

Pandoc supports definition lists, using the syntax of
[PHP Markdown Extra] with some extensions.[^3]

    Term 1

    :   Definition 1

    Term 2 with *inline markup*

    :   Definition 2

            { some code, part of Definition 2 }

        Third paragraph of definition 2.

Each term must fit on one line, which may optionally be followed by
a blank line, and must be followed by one or more definitions.
A definition begins with a colon or tilde, which may be indented one
or two spaces.

A term may have multiple definitions, and each definition may
consist of one or more block elements (paragraph, code block,
list, etc.), each indented four spaces or one tab stop.  The
body of the definition (not including the first line)
should be indented four spaces. However, as with
other Markdown lists, you can "lazily" omit indentation except
at the beginning of a paragraph or other block element:

    Term 1

    :   Definition
    with lazy continuation.

        Second paragraph of the definition.

If you leave space before the definition (as in the example above),
the text of the definition will be treated as a paragraph.  In some
output formats, this will mean greater spacing between term/definition
pairs. For a more compact definition list, omit the space before the
definition:

    Term 1
      ~ Definition 1

    Term 2
      ~ Definition 2a
      ~ Definition 2b

Note that space between items in a definition list is required.
(A variant that loosens this requirement, but disallows "lazy"
hard wrapping, can be activated with the [`compact_definition_lists`
extension][Extension: `compact_definition_lists`].)

[^3]:  I have been influenced by the suggestions of [David
  Wheeler](https://justatheory.com/2009/02/modest-markdown-proposal/).

### Numbered example lists ###

#### Extension: `example_lists` ####

The special list marker `@` can be used for sequentially numbered
examples. The first list item with a `@` marker will be numbered '1',
the next '2', and so on, throughout the document. The numbered examples
need not occur in a single list; each new list using `@` will take up
where the last stopped. So, for example:

    (@)  My first example will be numbered (1).
    (@)  My second example will be numbered (2).

    Explanation of examples.

    (@)  My third example will be numbered (3).

Numbered examples can be labeled and referred to elsewhere in the
document:

    (@good)  This is a good example.

    As (@good) illustrates, ...

The label can be any string of alphanumeric characters, underscores,
or hyphens.

Note:  continuation paragraphs in example lists must always
be indented four spaces, regardless of the length of the
list marker.  That is, example lists always behave as if the
`four_space_rule` extension is set.  This is because example
labels tend to be long, and indenting content to the
first non-space character after the label would be awkward.


### Ending a list ###

What if you want to put an indented code block after a list?

    -   item one
    -   item two

        { my code block }

Trouble! Here pandoc (like other Markdown implementations) will treat
`{ my code block }` as the second paragraph of item two, and not as
a code block.

To "cut off" the list after item two, you can insert some non-indented
content, like an HTML comment, which won't produce visible output in
any format:

    -   item one
    -   item two

    <!-- end of list -->

        { my code block }

You can use the same trick if you want two consecutive lists instead
of one big list:

    1.  one
    2.  two
    3.  three

    <!-- -->

    1.  uno
    2.  dos
    3.  tres

## Horizontal rules

A line containing a row of three or more `*`, `-`, or `_` characters
(optionally separated by spaces) produces a horizontal rule:

    *  *  *  *

    ---------------

We strongly recommend that horizontal rules be separated from
surrounding text by blank lines.  If a horizontal rule is not
followed by a blank line, pandoc may try to interpret the
lines that follow as a YAML metadata block or a table.

## Tables

Four kinds of tables may be used. The first three kinds presuppose the use of
a fixed-width font, such as Courier. The fourth kind can be used with
proportionally spaced fonts, as it does not require lining up columns.

#### Extension: `table_captions` ####

A caption may optionally be provided with all 4 kinds of tables (as
illustrated in the examples below). A caption is a paragraph beginning
with the string `Table:` (or `table:` or just `:`), which will be stripped
off. It may appear either before or after the table.

#### Extension: `simple_tables` ####

Simple tables look like this:

      Right     Left     Center     Default
    -------     ------ ----------   -------
         12     12        12            12
        123     123       123          123
          1     1          1             1

    Table:  Demonstration of simple table syntax.

The header and table rows must each fit on one line.  Column
alignments are determined by the position of the header text relative
to the dashed line below it:[^4]

  - If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the right side
    but extends beyond it on the left, the column is right-aligned.
  - If the dashed line is flush with the header text on the left side
    but extends beyond it on the right, the column is left-aligned.
  - If the dashed line extends beyond the header text on both sides,
    the column is centered.
  - If the dashed line is flush with the header text on both sides,
    the default alignment is used (in most cases, this will be left).

[^4]:  This scheme is due to Michel Fortin, who proposed it on the
       [Markdown discussion list](http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2005-March/001097.html).

The table must end with a blank line, or a line of dashes followed by
a blank line.

The column header row may be omitted, provided a dashed line is used
to end the table. For example:

    -------     ------ ----------   -------
         12     12        12             12
        123     123       123           123
          1     1          1              1
    -------     ------ ----------   -------

When the header row is omitted, column alignments are determined on the basis
of the first line of the table body. So, in the tables above, the columns
would be right, left, center, and right aligned, respectively.

#### Extension: `multiline_tables` ####

Multiline tables allow header and table rows to span multiple lines
of text (but cells that span multiple columns or rows of the table are
not supported).  Here is an example:

    -------------------------------------------------------------
     Centered   Default           Right Left
      Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
    ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
       First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                        spans multiple lines.

      Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                        the blank line between
                                        rows.
    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Table: Here's the caption. It, too, may span
    multiple lines.

These work like simple tables, but with the following differences:

  - They must begin with a row of dashes, before the header text
    (unless the header row is omitted).
  - They must end with a row of dashes, then a blank line.
  - The rows must be separated by blank lines.

In multiline tables, the table parser pays attention to the widths of
the columns, and the writers try to reproduce these relative widths in
the output. So, if you find that one of the columns is too narrow in the
output, try widening it in the Markdown source.

The header may be omitted in multiline tables as well as simple tables:

    ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
       First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                        spans multiple lines.

      Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                        the blank line between
                                        rows.
    ----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------

    : Here's a multiline table without a header.

It is possible for a multiline table to have just one row, but the row
should be followed by a blank line (and then the row of dashes that ends
the table), or the table may be interpreted as a simple table.

#### Extension: `grid_tables` ####

Grid tables look like this:

    : Sample grid table.

    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
    | Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
    +===============+===============+====================+
    | Bananas       | $1.34         | - built-in wrapper |
    |               |               | - bright color     |
    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
    | Oranges       | $2.10         | - cures scurvy     |
    |               |               | - tasty            |
    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

The row of `=`s separates the header from the table body,
and can be omitted for a headerless table. The cells of grid
tables may contain arbitrary block elements (multiple
paragraphs, code blocks, lists, etc.).

Cells can span multiple columns or rows:

    +---------------------+----------+
    | Property            | Earth    |
    +=============+=======+==========+
    |             | min   | -89.2 °C |
    | Temperature +-------+----------+
    | 1961-1990   | mean  | 14 °C    |
    |             +-------+----------+
    |             | max   | 56.7 °C  |
    +-------------+-------+----------+

A table header may contain more than one row:

    +---------------------+-----------------------+
    | Location            | Temperature 1961-1990 |
    |                     | in degree Celsius     |
    |                     +-------+-------+-------+
    |                     | min   | mean  | max   |
    +=====================+=======+=======+=======+
    | Antarctica          | -89.2 | N/A   | 19.8  |
    +---------------------+-------+-------+-------+
    | Earth               | -89.2 | 14    | 56.7  |
    +---------------------+-------+-------+-------+

Alignments can be specified as with pipe tables, by putting
colons at the boundaries of the separator line after the
header:

    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+
    | Right         | Left          | Centered           |
    +==============:+:==============+:==================:+
    | Bananas       | $1.34         | built-in wrapper   |
    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

For headerless tables, the colons go on the top line instead:

    +--------------:+:--------------+:------------------:+
    | Right         | Left          | Centered           |
    +---------------+---------------+--------------------+

A table foot can be defined by enclosing it with separator lines
that use `=` instead of `-`:

     +---------------+---------------+
     | Fruit         | Price         |
     +===============+===============+
     | Bananas       | $1.34         |
     +---------------+---------------+
     | Oranges       | $2.10         |
     +===============+===============+
     | Sum           | $3.44         |
     +===============+===============+

The foot must always be placed at the very bottom of the table.

Grid tables can be created easily using Emacs' table-mode
(`M-x table-insert`).

#### Extension: `pipe_tables` ####

Pipe tables look like this:

    | Right | Left | Default | Center |
    |------:|:-----|---------|:------:|
    |   12  |  12  |    12   |    12  |
    |  123  |  123 |   123   |   123  |
    |    1  |    1 |     1   |     1  |

      : Demonstration of pipe table syntax.

The syntax is identical to [PHP Markdown Extra tables].  The beginning and
ending pipe characters are optional, but pipes are required between all
columns.  The colons indicate column alignment as shown.  The header
cannot be omitted.  To simulate a headerless table, include a header
with blank cells.

Since the pipes indicate column boundaries, columns need not be vertically
aligned, as they are in the above example.  So, this is a perfectly
legal (though ugly) pipe table:

    fruit| price
    -----|-----:
    apple|2.05
    pear|1.37
    orange|3.09

The cells of pipe tables cannot contain block elements like paragraphs
and lists, and cannot span multiple lines.  If any line of the
markdown source is longer than the column width (see `--columns`),
then the table will take up the full text width and the cell
contents will wrap, with the relative cell widths determined by
the number of dashes in the line separating the table header
from the table body. (For example `---|-` would make the first column 3/4
and the second column 1/4 of the full text width.)
On the other hand, if no lines are wider than column width, then
cell contents will not be wrapped, and the cells will be sized
to their contents.

Note:  pandoc also recognizes pipe tables of the following
form, as can be produced by Emacs' orgtbl-mode:

    | One | Two   |
    |-----+-------|
    | my  | table |
    | is  | nice  |

The difference is that `+` is used instead of `|`. Other orgtbl features
are not supported. In particular, to get non-default column alignment,
you'll need to add colons as above.

## Metadata blocks

#### Extension: `pandoc_title_block` ####

If the file begins with a title block

    % title
    % author(s) (separated by semicolons)
    % date

it will be parsed as bibliographic information, not regular text.  (It
will be used, for example, in the title of standalone LaTeX or HTML
output.)  The block may contain just a title, a title and an author,
or all three elements. If you want to include an author but no
title, or a title and a date but no author, you need a blank line:

```
%
% Author
```

```
% My title
%
% June 15, 2006
```

The title may occupy multiple lines, but continuation lines must
begin with leading space, thus:

```
% My title
  on multiple lines
```

If a document has multiple authors, the authors may be put on
separate lines with leading space, or separated by semicolons, or
both.  So, all of the following are equivalent:

```
% Author One
  Author Two
```

```
% Author One; Author Two
```

```
% Author One;
  Author Two
```

The date must fit on one line.

All three metadata fields may contain standard inline formatting
(italics, links, footnotes, etc.).

Title blocks will always be parsed, but they will affect the output only
when the `--standalone` (`-s`) option is chosen. In HTML output, titles
will appear twice: once in the document head -- this is the title that
will appear at the top of the window in a browser -- and once at the
beginning of the document body. The title in the document head can have
an optional prefix attached (`--title-prefix` or `-T` option). The title
in the body appears as an H1 element with class "title", so it can be
suppressed or reformatted with CSS. If a title prefix is specified with
`-T` and no title block appears in the document, the title prefix will
be used by itself as the HTML title.

The man page writer extracts a title, man page section number, and
other header and footer information from the title line. The title
is assumed to be the first word on the title line, which may optionally
end with a (single-digit) section number in parentheses. (There should
be no space between the title and the parentheses.)  Anything after
this is assumed to be additional footer and header text. A single pipe
character (`|`) should be used to separate the footer text from the header
text.  Thus,

    % PANDOC(1)

will yield a man page with the title `PANDOC` and section 1.

    % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals

will also have "Pandoc User Manuals" in the footer.

    % PANDOC(1) Pandoc User Manuals | Version 4.0

will also have "Version 4.0" in the header.

#### Extension: `yaml_metadata_block` ####

A [YAML] metadata block is a valid YAML object, delimited by a line of three
hyphens (`---`) at the top and a line of three hyphens (`---`) or three dots
(`...`) at the bottom.  The initial line `---` must not be followed by a blank
line. A YAML metadata block may occur anywhere in the document, but if
it is not at the beginning, it must be preceded by a blank line.

Note that, because of the way pandoc concatenates input files
when several are provided, you may also keep the metadata in a
separate YAML file and pass it to pandoc as an argument, along
with your Markdown files:

    pandoc chap1.md chap2.md chap3.md metadata.yaml -s -o book.html

Just be sure that the YAML file begins with `---` and ends with `---` or
`...`. Alternatively, you can use the `--metadata-file` option. Using
that approach however, you cannot reference content (like footnotes)
from the main markdown input document.

Metadata will be taken from the fields of the YAML object and added to any
existing document metadata.  Metadata can contain lists and objects (nested
arbitrarily), but all string scalars will be interpreted as Markdown.  Fields
with names ending in an underscore will be ignored by pandoc.  (They may be
given a role by external processors.)  Field names must not be
interpretable as YAML numbers or boolean values (so, for
example, `yes`, `True`, and `15` cannot be used as field names).

A document may contain multiple metadata blocks.  If two
metadata blocks attempt to set the same field, the value from
the second block will be taken.

Each metadata block is handled internally as an independent YAML document.
This means, for example, that any YAML anchors defined in a block cannot be
referenced in another block.

When pandoc is used with `-t markdown` to create a Markdown document,
a YAML metadata block will be produced only if the `-s/--standalone`
option is used.  All of the metadata will appear in a single block
at the beginning of the document.

Note that [YAML] escaping rules must be followed. Thus, for example,
if a title contains a colon, it must be quoted, and if it contains a
backslash escape, then it must be ensured that it is not treated as a
[YAML escape sequence]. The pipe character (`|`) can be used to begin
an indented block that will be interpreted literally, without need for
escaping. This form is necessary when the field contains blank lines
or block-level formatting:

    ---
    title:  'This is the title: it contains a colon'
    author:
    - Author One
    - Author Two
    keywords: [nothing, nothingness]
    abstract: |
      This is the abstract.

      It consists of two paragraphs.
    ...

The literal block after the `|` must be indented relative to the
line containing the `|`.  If it is not, the YAML will be invalid
and pandoc will not interpret it as metadata.  For an overview
of the complex rules governing YAML, see the [Wikipedia entry on
YAML syntax].

Template variables will be set automatically from the metadata.  Thus, for
example, in writing HTML, the variable `abstract` will be set to the HTML
equivalent of the Markdown in the `abstract` field:

    <p>This is the abstract.</p>
    <p>It consists of two paragraphs.</p>

Variables can contain arbitrary YAML structures, but the template must match
this structure.  The `author` variable in the default templates expects a
simple list or string, but can be changed to support more complicated
structures.  The following combination, for example, would add an affiliation
to the author if one is given:

    ---
    title: The document title
    author:
    - name: Author One
      affiliation: University of Somewhere
    - name: Author Two
      affiliation: University of Nowhere
    ...

To use the structured authors in the example above, you would need a custom
template:

    $for(author)$
    $if(author.name)$
    $author.name$$if(author.affiliation)$ ($author.affiliation$)$endif$
    $else$
    $author$
    $endif$
    $endfor$

Raw content to include in the document's header may be specified
using `header-includes`; however, it is important to mark up
this content as raw code for a particular output format, using
the [`raw_attribute` extension](#extension-raw_attribute), or it
will be interpreted as markdown. For example:

    header-includes:
    - |
      ```{=latex}
      \let\oldsection\section
      \renewcommand{\section}[1]{\clearpage\oldsection{#1}}
      ```

Note:  the `yaml_metadata_block` extension works with
`commonmark` as well as `markdown` (and it is enabled by default
in `gfm` and `commonmark_x`).  However, in these formats the
following restrictions apply:

- The YAML metadata block must occur at the beginning of the
  document (and there can be only one).  If multiple files are
  given as arguments to pandoc, only the first can be a YAML
  metadata block.

- The leaf nodes of the YAML structure are parsed in isolation from
  each other and from the rest of the document.  So, for
  example,  you can't use a reference link in these contexts
  if the link definition is somewhere else in the document.

## Backslash escapes

#### Extension: `all_symbols_escapable` ####

Except inside a code block or inline code, any punctuation or space
character preceded by a backslash will be treated literally, even if it
would normally indicate formatting.  Thus, for example, if one writes

    *\*hello\**

one will get

    <em>*hello*</em>

instead of

    <strong>hello</strong>

This rule is easier to remember than original Markdown's rule,
which allows only the following characters to be backslash-escaped:

    \`*_{}[]()>#+-.!

(However, if the `markdown_strict` format is used, the original Markdown rule
will be used.)

A backslash-escaped space is parsed as a nonbreaking space. In TeX output,
it will appear as `~`. In HTML and XML output, it will appear as a
literal unicode nonbreaking space character (note that it will thus
actually look "invisible" in the generated HTML source; you can still
use the `--ascii` command-line option to make it appear as an explicit
entity).

A backslash-escaped newline (i.e. a backslash occurring at the end of
a line) is parsed as a hard line break.  It will appear in TeX output as
`\\` and in HTML as `<br />`.  This is a nice alternative to
Markdown's "invisible" way of indicating hard line breaks using
two trailing spaces on a line.

Backslash escapes do not work in verbatim contexts.

## Inline formatting

### Emphasis ###

To *emphasize* some text, surround it with `*`s or `_`, like this:

    This text is _emphasized with underscores_, and this
    is *emphasized with asterisks*.

Double `*` or `_` produces **strong emphasis**:

    This is **strong emphasis** and __with underscores__.

A `*` or `_` character surrounded by spaces, or backslash-escaped,
will not trigger emphasis:

    This is * not emphasized *, and \*neither is this\*.

#### Extension: `intraword_underscores` ####

Because `_` is sometimes used inside words and identifiers,
pandoc does not interpret a `_` surrounded by alphanumeric
characters as an emphasis marker.  If you want to emphasize
just part of a word, use `*`:

    feas*ible*, not feas*able*.

### Strikeout ###

#### Extension: `strikeout` ####

To strike out a section of text with a horizontal line, begin and end it
with `~~`. Thus, for example,

    This ~~is deleted text.~~


### Superscripts and subscripts ###

#### Extension: `superscript`, `subscript` ####

Superscripts may be written by surrounding the superscripted text by `^`
characters; subscripts may be written by surrounding the subscripted
text by `~` characters.  Thus, for example,

    H~2~O is a liquid.  2^10^ is 1024.

The text between `^...^` or `~...~` may not contain spaces or
newlines.  If the superscripted or subscripted text contains
spaces, these spaces must be escaped with backslashes.  (This is
to prevent accidental superscripting and subscripting through
the ordinary use of `~` and `^`, and also bad interactions with
footnotes.) Thus, if you want the letter P with 'a cat' in
subscripts, use `P~a\ cat~`, not `P~a cat~`.

### Verbatim ###

To make a short span of text verbatim, put it inside backticks:

    What is the difference between `>>=` and `>>`?

If the verbatim text includes a backtick, use double backticks:

    Here is a literal backtick `` ` ``.

(The spaces after the opening backticks and before the closing
backticks will be ignored.)

The general rule is that a verbatim span starts with a string
of consecutive backticks (optionally followed by a space)
and ends with a string of the same number of backticks (optionally
preceded by a space).

Note that backslash-escapes (and other Markdown constructs) do not
work in verbatim contexts:

    This is a backslash followed by an asterisk: `\*`.

#### Extension: `inline_code_attributes` ####

Attributes can be attached to verbatim text, just as with
[fenced code blocks]:

    `<$>`{.haskell}

### Underline ###

To underline text, use the `underline` class:

    [Underline]{.underline}

Or, without the `bracketed_spans` extension (but with `native_spans`):

    <span class="underline">Underline</span>

This will work in all output formats that support underline.

### Small caps ###

To write small caps, use the `smallcaps` class:

    [Small caps]{.smallcaps}

Or, without the `bracketed_spans` extension:

    <span class="smallcaps">Small caps</span>

For compatibility with other Markdown flavors, CSS is also supported:

    <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small caps</span>

This will work in all output formats that support small caps.

### Highlighting ###

To highlight text, use the `mark` class:

    [Mark]{.mark}

Or, without the `bracketed_spans` extension (but with `native_spans`):

    <span class="mark">Mark</span>

This will work in all output formats that support highlighting.


## Math

#### Extension: `tex_math_dollars` ####

Anything between two `$` characters will be treated as TeX math.  The
opening `$` must have a non-space character immediately to its right,
while the closing `$` must have a non-space character immediately to its
left, and must not be followed immediately by a digit.  Thus,
`$20,000 and $30,000` won't parse as math.  If for some reason
you need to enclose text in literal `$` characters, backslash-escape
them and they won't be treated as math delimiters.

For display math, use `$$` delimiters.  (In this case, the delimiters
may be separated from the formula by whitespace.  However, there can be
no blank lines between the opening and closing `$$` delimiters.)

TeX math will be printed in all output formats. How it is rendered
depends on the output format:

LaTeX
  ~ It will appear verbatim surrounded by `\(...\)` (for inline
    math) or `\[...\]` (for display math).

Markdown, Emacs Org mode, ConTeXt, ZimWiki
  ~ It will appear verbatim surrounded by `$...$` (for inline
    math) or `$$...$$` (for display math).

XWiki
  ~ It will appear verbatim surrounded by `{{formula}}..{{/formula}}`.

reStructuredText
  ~ It will be rendered using an [interpreted text role `:math:`].

AsciiDoc
  ~ For AsciiDoc output math will appear verbatim surrounded by
    `latexmath:[...]`. For `asciidoc_legacy` the bracketed
    material will also include inline or display math delimiters.

Texinfo
  ~ It will be rendered inside a `@math` command.

roff man, Jira markup
  ~ It will be rendered verbatim without `$`'s.

MediaWiki, DokuWiki
  ~ It will be rendered inside `<math>` tags.

Textile
  ~ It will be rendered inside `<span class="math">` tags.

RTF, OpenDocument
  ~ It will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters,
    and will otherwise appear verbatim.

ODT
  ~ It will be rendered, if possible, using MathML.

DocBook
  ~ If the `--mathml` flag is used, it will be rendered using MathML
    in an `inlineequation` or `informalequation` tag.  Otherwise it
    will be rendered, if possible, using Unicode characters.

Docx and PowerPoint
  ~ It will be rendered using OMML math markup.

FictionBook2
  ~ If the `--webtex` option is used, formulas are rendered as images
    using CodeCogs or other compatible web service, downloaded
    and embedded in the e-book. Otherwise, they will appear verbatim.

HTML, Slidy, DZSlides, S5, EPUB
  ~ The way math is rendered in HTML will depend on the
    command-line options selected. Therefore see [Math rendering in HTML]
    above.

[interpreted text role `:math:`]: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/roles.html#math

## Raw HTML

#### Extension: `raw_html` ####

Markdown allows you to insert raw HTML (or DocBook) anywhere in a document
(except verbatim contexts, where `<`, `>`, and `&` are interpreted
literally).  (Technically this is not an extension, since standard
Markdown allows it, but it has been made an extension so that it can
be disabled if desired.)

The raw HTML is passed through unchanged in HTML, S5, Slidy, Slideous,
DZSlides, EPUB, Markdown, CommonMark, Emacs Org mode, and Textile
output, and suppressed in other formats.

For a more explicit way of including raw HTML in a Markdown
document, see the [`raw_attribute` extension][Extension: `raw_attribute`].

In the CommonMark format, if `raw_html` is enabled, superscripts,
subscripts, strikeouts and small capitals will be represented as HTML.
Otherwise, plain-text fallbacks will be used. Note that even if
`raw_html` is disabled, tables will be rendered with HTML syntax if
they cannot use pipe syntax.

#### Extension: `markdown_in_html_blocks` ####

Original Markdown allows you to include HTML "blocks":  blocks
of HTML between balanced tags that are separated from the surrounding text
with blank lines, and start and end at the left margin.  Within
these blocks, everything is interpreted as HTML, not Markdown;
so (for example), `*` does not signify emphasis.

Pandoc behaves this way when the `markdown_strict` format is used; but
by default, pandoc interprets material between HTML block tags as Markdown.
Thus, for example, pandoc will turn

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td>*one*</td>
    <td>[a link](https://google.com)</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

into

    <table>
    <tr>
    <td><em>one</em></td>
    <td><a href="https://google.com">a link</a></td>
    </tr>
    </table>

whereas `Markdown.pl` will preserve it as is.

There is one exception to this rule:  text between `<script>`,
`<style>`, and `<textarea>` tags is not interpreted as Markdown.

This departure from original Markdown should make it easier to mix
Markdown with HTML block elements.  For example, one can surround
a block of Markdown text with `<div>` tags without preventing it
from being interpreted as Markdown.

#### Extension: `native_divs` ####

Use native pandoc `Div` blocks for content inside `<div>` tags.
For the most part this should give the same output as
`markdown_in_html_blocks`, but it makes it easier to write pandoc
filters to manipulate groups of blocks.

#### Extension: `native_spans` ####

Use native pandoc `Span` blocks for content inside `<span>` tags.
For the most part this should give the same output as `raw_html`,
but it makes it easier to write pandoc filters to manipulate groups
of inlines.

#### Extension: `raw_tex` ####

In addition to raw HTML, pandoc allows raw LaTeX, TeX, and ConTeXt to be
included in a document. Inline TeX commands will be preserved and passed
unchanged to the LaTeX and ConTeXt writers. Thus, for example, you can use
LaTeX to include BibTeX citations:

    This result was proved in \cite{jones.1967}.

Note that in LaTeX environments, like

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}\hline
    Age & Frequency \\ \hline
    18--25  & 15 \\
    26--35  & 33 \\
    36--45  & 22 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}

the material between the begin and end tags will be interpreted as raw
LaTeX, not as Markdown.

For a more explicit and flexible way of including raw TeX in a
Markdown document, see the [`raw_attribute`
extension][Extension: `raw_attribute`].

Inline LaTeX is ignored in output formats other than Markdown, LaTeX,
Emacs Org mode, and ConTeXt.

### Generic raw attribute ###

#### Extension: `raw_attribute` ####

Inline spans and fenced code blocks with a special
kind of attribute will be parsed as raw content with the
designated format.  For example, the following produces a raw
roff `ms` block:

    ```{=ms}
    .MYMACRO
    blah blah
    ```
And the following produces a raw `html` inline element:

    This is `<a>html</a>`{=html}

This can be useful to insert raw xml into `docx` documents, e.g.
a pagebreak:

    ```{=openxml}
    <w:p>
      <w:r>
        <w:br w:type="page"/>
      </w:r>
    </w:p>
    ```

The format name should match the target format name (see
`-t/--to`, above, for a list, or use `pandoc
--list-output-formats`). Use `openxml` for `docx` output,
`opendocument` for `odt` output, `html5` for `epub3` output,
`html4` for `epub2` output, and `latex`, `beamer`,
`ms`, or `html5` for `pdf` output (depending on what you
use for `--pdf-engine`).

This extension presupposes that the relevant kind of
inline code or fenced code block is enabled.  Thus, for
example, to use a raw attribute with a backtick code block,
`backtick_code_blocks` must be enabled.

The raw attribute cannot be combined with regular attributes.

## LaTeX macros

#### Extension: `latex_macros` ####

When this extension is enabled, pandoc will parse LaTeX
macro definitions and apply the resulting macros to all LaTeX
math and raw LaTeX.  So, for example, the following will work in
all output formats, not just LaTeX:

    \newcommand{\tuple}[1]{\langle #1 \rangle}

    $\tuple{a, b, c}$

Note that LaTeX macros will not be applied if they occur
inside a raw span or block marked with the
[`raw_attribute` extension](#extension-raw_attribute).

When `latex_macros` is disabled, the raw LaTeX and math will
not have macros applied. This is usually a better approach when
you are targeting LaTeX or PDF.

Macro definitions in LaTeX will be passed through as raw LaTeX
only if `latex_macros` is not enabled.  Macro definitions in
Markdown source (or other formats allowing `raw_tex`) will
be passed through regardless of whether `latex_macros` is
enabled.

## Links

Markdown allows links to be specified in several ways.

### Automatic links ###

If you enclose a URL or email address in pointy brackets, it
will become a link:

    <https://google.com>
    <sam@green.eggs.ham>

### Inline links ###

An inline link consists of the link text in square brackets,
followed by the URL in parentheses. (Optionally, the URL can
be followed by a link title, in quotes.)

    This is an [inline link](/url), and here's [one with
    a title](https://fsf.org "click here for a good time!").

There can be no space between the bracketed part and the parenthesized part.
The link text can contain formatting (such as emphasis), but the title cannot.

Email addresses in inline links are not autodetected, so they have to be
prefixed with `mailto`:

    [Write me!](mailto:sam@green.eggs.ham)

### Reference links ###

An *explicit* reference link has two parts, the link itself and the link
definition, which may occur elsewhere in the document (either
before or after the link).

The link consists of link text in square brackets, followed by a label in
square brackets. (There cannot be space between the two unless the
`spaced_reference_links` extension is enabled.) The link definition
consists of the bracketed label, followed by a colon and a space, followed by
the URL, and optionally (after a space) a link title either in quotes or in
parentheses.  The label must not be parseable as a citation (assuming
the `citations` extension is enabled):  citations take precedence over
link labels.

Here are some examples:

    [my label 1]: /foo/bar.html  "My title, optional"
    [my label 2]: /foo
    [my label 3]: https://fsf.org (The Free Software Foundation)
    [my label 4]: /bar#special  'A title in single quotes'

The URL may optionally be surrounded by angle brackets:

    [my label 5]: <http://foo.bar.baz>

The title may go on the next line:

    [my label 3]: https://fsf.org
      "The Free Software Foundation"

Note that link labels are not case sensitive.  So, this will work:

    Here is [my link][FOO]

    [Foo]: /bar/baz

In an *implicit* reference link, the second pair of brackets is
empty:

    See [my website][].

    [my website]: http://foo.bar.baz

Note:  In `Markdown.pl` and most other Markdown implementations,
reference link definitions cannot occur in nested constructions
such as list items or block quotes.  Pandoc lifts this
arbitrary-seeming restriction.  So the following is fine in pandoc,
though not in most other implementations:

    > My block [quote].
    >
    > [quote]: /foo

#### Extension: `shortcut_reference_links` ####

In a *shortcut* reference link, the second pair of brackets may
be omitted entirely:

    See [my website].

    [my website]: http://foo.bar.baz

### Internal links ###

To link to another section of the same document, use the automatically
generated identifier (see [Heading identifiers]). For example:

    See the [Introduction](#introduction).

or

    See the [Introduction].

    [Introduction]: #introduction

Internal links are currently supported for HTML formats (including
HTML slide shows and EPUB), LaTeX, and ConTeXt.

## Images

A link immediately preceded by a `!` will be treated as an image.
The link text will be used as the image's alt text:

    ![la lune](lalune.jpg "Voyage to the moon")

    ![movie reel]

    [movie reel]: movie.gif

#### Extension: `implicit_figures` ####

An image with nonempty alt text, occurring by itself in a
paragraph, will be rendered as a figure with a caption.  The
image's alt text will be used as the caption.

    ![This is the caption](/url/of/image.png)

How this is rendered depends on the output format. Some output
formats (e.g. RTF) do not yet support figures.  In those
formats, you'll just get an image in a paragraph by itself, with
no caption.

If you just want a regular inline image, just make sure it is not
the only thing in the paragraph. One way to do this is to insert a
nonbreaking space after the image:

    ![This image won't be a figure](/url/of/image.png)\

Note that in reveal.js slide shows, an image in a paragraph
by itself that has the `r-stretch` class will fill the screen,
and the caption and figure tags will be omitted.

#### Extension: `link_attributes` ####

Attributes can be set on links and images:

    An inline ![image](foo.jpg){#id .class width=30 height=20px}
    and a reference ![image][ref] with attributes.

    [ref]: foo.jpg "optional title" {#id .class key=val key2="val 2"}

(This syntax is compatible with [PHP Markdown Extra] when only `#id`
and `.class` are used.)

For HTML and EPUB, all known HTML5 attributes except `width` and
`height` (but including `srcset` and `sizes`) are passed through
as is. Unknown attributes are passed through as custom
attributes, with `data-` prepended. The other writers ignore
attributes that are not specifically supported by their output format.

The `width` and `height` attributes on images are treated specially. When
used without a unit, the unit is assumed to be pixels. However, any of
the following unit identifiers can be used: `px`, `cm`, `mm`, `in`, `inch`
and `%`. There must not be any spaces between the number and the unit.
For example:

```
![](file.jpg){ width=50% }
```

- Dimensions may be converted to a form that is compatible with
  the output format (for example, dimensions given in pixels will
  be converted to inches when converting HTML to LaTeX). Conversion
  between pixels and physical measurements is affected by the
  `--dpi` option (by default, 96 dpi is assumed, unless the image
  itself contains dpi information).
- The `%` unit is generally relative to some available space.
  For example the above example will render to the following.
  - HTML: `<img href="file.jpg" style="width: 50%;" />`
  - LaTeX: `\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth,height=\textheight]{file.jpg}`
    (If you're using a custom template, you need to configure `graphicx`
    as in the default template.)
  - ConTeXt: `\externalfigure[file.jpg][width=0.5\textwidth]`
- Some output formats have a notion of a class
  ([ConTeXt](https://wiki.contextgarden.net/Using_Graphics#Multiple_Image_Settings))
  or a unique identifier (LaTeX `\caption`), or both (HTML).
- When no `width` or `height` attributes are specified, the fallback
  is to look at the image resolution and the dpi metadata embedded in
  the image file.

## Divs and Spans

Using the `native_divs` and `native_spans` extensions
(see [above][Extension: `native_divs`]), HTML syntax can
be used as part of markdown to create native `Div` and `Span`
elements in the pandoc AST (as opposed to raw HTML).
However, there is also nicer syntax available:

#### Extension: `fenced_divs` ####

Allow special fenced syntax for native `Div` blocks.  A Div
starts with a fence containing at least three consecutive
colons plus some attributes. The attributes may optionally
be followed by another string of consecutive colons.

Note:  the `commonmark` parser doesn't permit colons after
the attributes.

The attribute syntax is exactly as in fenced code blocks (see
[Extension: `fenced_code_attributes`]).  As with fenced
code blocks, one can use either attributes in curly braces
or a single unbraced word, which will be treated as a class
name.  The Div ends with another line containing a string of at
least three consecutive colons.  The fenced Div should be
separated by blank lines from preceding and following blocks.

Example:

    ::::: {#special .sidebar}
    Here is a paragraph.

    And another.
    :::::

Fenced divs can be nested.  Opening fences are distinguished
because they *must* have attributes:

    ::: Warning ::::::
    This is a warning.

    ::: Danger
    This is a warning within a warning.
    :::
    ::::::::::::::::::

Fences without attributes are always closing fences.  Unlike
with fenced code blocks, the number of colons in the closing
fence need not match the number in the opening fence.  However,
it can be helpful for visual clarity to use fences of different
lengths to distinguish nested divs from their parents.


#### Extension: `bracketed_spans` ####

A bracketed sequence of inlines, as one would use to begin
a link, will be treated as a `Span` with attributes if it is
followed immediately by attributes:

    [This is *some text*]{.class key="val"}

## Footnotes

#### Extension: `footnotes` ####

Pandoc's Markdown allows footnotes, using the following syntax:

    Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

    [^1]: Here is the footnote.

    [^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

        Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
    belong to the previous footnote.

            { some.code }

        The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
        line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
        multi-paragraph list items.

    This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
    isn't indented.

The identifiers in footnote references may not contain spaces, tabs,
newlines, or the characters `^`, `[`, or `]`. These identifiers
are used only to correlate the footnote reference with the note
itself; in the output, footnotes will be numbered sequentially.

The footnotes themselves need not be placed at the end of the
document.  They may appear anywhere except inside other block elements
(lists, block quotes, tables, etc.).  Each footnote should be
separated from surrounding content (including other footnotes)
by blank lines.

#### Extension: `inline_notes` ####

Inline footnotes are also allowed (though, unlike regular notes,
they cannot contain multiple paragraphs).  The syntax is as follows:

    Here is an inline note.^[Inline notes are easier to write, since
    you don't have to pick an identifier and move down to type the
    note.]

Inline and regular footnotes may be mixed freely.

## Citation syntax

#### Extension: `citations` ####

To cite a bibliographic item with an identifier foo, use the
syntax `@foo`.  Normal citations should be included in square
brackets, with semicolons separating distinct items:

    Blah blah [@doe99; @smith2000; @smith2004].

How this is rendered depends on the citation style.  In an
author-date style, it might render as

    Blah blah (Doe 1999, Smith 2000, 2004).

In a footnote style, it might render as

    Blah blah.[^1]

    [^1]:  John Doe, "Frogs," *Journal of Amphibians* 44 (1999);
    Susan Smith, "Flies," *Journal of Insects* (2000);
    Susan Smith, "Bees," *Journal of Insects* (2004).

See the [CSL user documentation] for more information about CSL
styles and how they affect rendering.

Unless a citation key starts with a letter, digit, or `_`,
and contains only alphanumerics and single internal punctuation
characters (`:.#$%&-+?<>~/`), it must be surrounded
by curly braces, which are not considered part of the key.
In `@Foo_bar.baz.`, the key is `Foo_bar.baz` because the final
period is not *internal* punctuation, so it is not included in
the key.  In `@{Foo_bar.baz.}`, the key is `Foo_bar.baz.`, including
the final period.
In `@Foo_bar--baz`, the key is `Foo_bar` because the repeated internal
punctuation characters terminate the key.
The curly braces are recommended if you use URLs as
keys: `[@{https://example.com/bib?name=foobar&date=2000}, p.  33]`.

Citation items may optionally include a prefix, a locator, and
a suffix.  In

    Blah blah [see @doe99, pp. 33-35 and *passim*; @smith04, chap. 1].

the first item (`doe99`) has prefix `see `, locator `pp.  33-35`,
and suffix `and *passim*`.  The second item (`smith04`) has
locator `chap. 1` and no prefix or suffix.

Pandoc uses some heuristics to separate the locator from the
rest of the subject.  It is sensitive to the locator terms
defined in the [CSL locale files].  Either abbreviated or
unabbreviated forms are accepted. In the `en-US` locale, locator
terms can be written in either singular or plural forms, as
`book`, `bk.`/`bks.`; `chapter`, `chap.`/`chaps.`; `column`,
`col.`/`cols.`; `figure`, `fig.`/`figs.`; `folio`,
`fol.`/`fols.`; `number`, `no.`/`nos.`; `line`, `l.`/`ll.`;
`note`, `n.`/`nn.`; `opus`, `op.`/`opp.`; `page`, `p.`/`pp.`;
`paragraph`, `para.`/`paras.`; `part`, `pt.`/`pts.`; `section`,
`sec.`/`secs.`; `sub verbo`, `s.v.`/`s.vv.`; `verse`,
`v.`/`vv.`; `volume`, `vol.`/`vols.`; `¶`/`¶¶`; `§`/`§§`. If no
locator term is used, "page" is assumed.

In complex cases, you can force something to be treated as
a locator by enclosing it in curly braces or prevent parsing
the suffix as locator by prepending curly braces:

    [@smith{ii, A, D-Z}, with a suffix]
    [@smith, {pp. iv, vi-xi, (xv)-(xvii)} with suffix here]
    [@smith{}, 99 years later]

A minus sign (`-`) before the `@` will suppress mention of
the author in the citation.  This can be useful when the
author is already mentioned in the text:

    Smith says blah [-@smith04].

You can also write an author-in-text citation, by omitting the
square brackets:

    @smith04 says blah.

    @smith04 [p. 33] says blah.

This will cause the author's name to be rendered, followed by
the bibliographical details.  Use this form when you want to
make the citation the subject of a sentence.

When you are using a note style, it is usually better to let
citeproc create the footnotes from citations rather than writing
an explicit note.  If you do write an explicit note that
contains a citation, note that normal citations will be put in
parentheses, while author-in-text citations will not.  For
this reason, it is sometimes preferable to use the
author-in-text style inside notes when using a note style.

## Non-default extensions

The following Markdown syntax extensions are not enabled by default
in pandoc, but may be enabled by adding `+EXTENSION` to the format
name, where `EXTENSION` is the name of the extension.  Thus, for
example, `markdown+hard_line_breaks` is Markdown with hard line breaks.

#### Extension: `rebase_relative_paths` ####

Rewrite relative paths for Markdown links and images, depending
on the path of the file containing the link or image link.  For
each link or image, pandoc will compute the directory of the
containing file, relative to the working directory, and prepend
the resulting path to the link or image path.

The use of this extension is best understood by example.
Suppose you have a subdirectory for each chapter of a book,
`chap1`, `chap2`, `chap3`. Each contains a file `text.md` and a
number of images used in the chapter.  You would like to have
`![image](spider.jpg)` in `chap1/text.md` refer to
`chap1/spider.jpg` and `![image](spider.jpg)` in `chap2/text.md`
refer to `chap2/spider.jpg`.  To do this, use

    pandoc chap*/*.md -f markdown+rebase_relative_paths

Without this extension, you would have to use
`![image](chap1/spider.jpg)` in `chap1/text.md` and
`![image](chap2/spider.jpg)` in `chap2/text.md`.  Links with
relative paths will be rewritten in the same way as images.

Absolute paths and URLs are not changed.  Neither are empty
paths or paths consisting entirely of a fragment, e.g., `#foo`.

Note that relative paths in reference links and images will
be rewritten relative to the file containing the link
reference definition, not the file containing the reference link
or image itself, if these differ.

#### Extension: `mark` ####

To highlight out a section of text, begin and end it with
with `==`. Thus, for example,

    This ==is deleted text.==

#### Extension: `attributes` ####

Allows attributes to be attached to any inline or block-level
element when parsing `commonmark`.
The syntax for the attributes is the same as that
used in [`header_attributes`][Extension: `header_attributes`].

- Attributes that occur immediately after an inline
  element affect that element.  If they follow a space, then they
  belong to the space.  (Hence, this option subsumes
  `inline_code_attributes` and `link_attributes`.)
- Attributes that occur immediately before a block
  element, on a line by themselves, affect that
  element.
- Consecutive attribute specifiers may be used,
  either for blocks or for inlines.  Their attributes
  will be combined.
- Attributes that occur at the end of the text of
  a Setext or ATX heading (separated by whitespace
  from the text) affect the heading element. (Hence, this
  option subsumes `header_attributes`.)
- Attributes that occur after the opening fence
  in a fenced code block affect the code block element. (Hence,
  this option subsumes `fenced_code_attributes`.)
- Attributes that occur at the end of a reference
  link definition affect links that refer to that
  definition.

Note that pandoc's AST does not currently allow attributes
to be attached to arbitrary elements.  Hence a Span or Div
container will be added if needed.

#### Extension: `old_dashes` ####

Selects the pandoc <= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart dashes:
`-` before a numeral is an en-dash, and `--` is an em-dash.
This option only has an effect if `smart` is enabled. It is
selected automatically for `textile` input.

#### Extension: `angle_brackets_escapable` ####

Allow `<` and `>` to be backslash-escaped, as they can be in
GitHub flavored Markdown but not original Markdown.  This is
implied by pandoc's default `all_symbols_escapable`.

#### Extension: `lists_without_preceding_blankline` ####

Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening
blank space.

#### Extension: `four_space_rule` ####

Selects the pandoc <= 2.0 behavior for parsing lists, so that
four spaces indent are needed for list item continuation
paragraphs.

#### Extension: `spaced_reference_links` ####

Allow whitespace between the two components of a reference link,
for example,

    [foo] [bar].

#### Extension: `hard_line_breaks` ####

Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line
breaks instead of spaces.

#### Extension: `ignore_line_breaks` ####

Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being
treated as spaces or as hard line breaks.  This option is intended for
use with East Asian languages where spaces are not used between words,
but text is divided into lines for readability.

#### Extension: `east_asian_line_breaks` ####

Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than
being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks, when they occur
between two East Asian wide characters.  This is a better choice
than `ignore_line_breaks` for texts that include a mix of East
Asian wide characters and other characters.

#### Extension: `emoji` ####

Parses textual emojis like `:smile:` as Unicode emoticons.

#### Extension: `tex_math_gfm` ####

Supports two GitHub-specific formats for math.
Inline math: ``$`e=mc^2`$``.

Display math:

````
``` math
e=mc^2
```
````

#### Extension: `tex_math_single_backslash` ####

Causes anything between `\(` and `\)` to be interpreted as inline
TeX math, and anything between `\[` and `\]` to be interpreted
as display TeX math.  Note: a drawback of this extension is that
it precludes escaping `(` and `[`.

#### Extension: `tex_math_double_backslash` ####

Causes anything between `\\(` and `\\)` to be interpreted as inline
TeX math, and anything between `\\[` and `\\]` to be interpreted
as display TeX math.

#### Extension: `markdown_attribute` ####

By default, pandoc interprets material inside block-level tags as Markdown.
This extension changes the behavior so that Markdown is only parsed
inside block-level tags if the tags have the attribute `markdown=1`.

#### Extension: `mmd_title_block` ####

Enables a [MultiMarkdown] style title block at the top of
the document, for example:

    Title:   My title
    Author:  John Doe
    Date:    September 1, 2008
    Comment: This is a sample mmd title block, with
             a field spanning multiple lines.

See the MultiMarkdown documentation for details.  If `pandoc_title_block` or
`yaml_metadata_block` is enabled, it will take precedence over
`mmd_title_block`.

#### Extension: `abbreviations` ####

Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like

    *[HTML]: Hypertext Markup Language

Note that the pandoc document model does not support
abbreviations, so if this extension is enabled, abbreviation keys are
simply skipped (as opposed to being parsed as paragraphs).

#### Extension: `autolink_bare_uris` ####

Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by
pointy braces `<...>`.

#### Extension: `mmd_link_attributes` ####

Parses multimarkdown style key-value attributes on link
and image references. This extension should not be confused with the
[`link_attributes`](#extension-link_attributes) extension.

    This is a reference ![image][ref] with multimarkdown attributes.

    [ref]: https://path.to/image "Image title" width=20px height=30px
           id=myId class="myClass1 myClass2"

#### Extension: `mmd_header_identifiers` ####

Parses multimarkdown style heading identifiers (in square brackets,
after the heading but before any trailing `#`s in an ATX heading).

#### Extension: `compact_definition_lists` ####

Activates the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier.
This syntax differs from the one described above under [Definition lists]
in several respects:

  - No blank line is required between consecutive items of the
    definition list.
  - To get a "tight" or "compact" list, omit space between consecutive
    items; the space between a term and its definition does not affect
    anything.
  - Lazy wrapping of paragraphs is not allowed:  the entire definition must
    be indented four spaces.[^6]

[^6]:  To see why laziness is incompatible with relaxing the requirement
    of a blank line between items, consider the following example:

        bar
        :    definition
        foo
        :    definition

    Is this a single list item with two definitions of "bar," the first of
    which is lazily wrapped, or two list items?  To remove the ambiguity
    we must either disallow lazy wrapping or require a blank line between
    list items.

#### Extension: `gutenberg` ####

Use [Project Gutenberg] conventions for `plain` output:
all-caps for strong emphasis, surround by underscores
for regular emphasis, add extra blank space around headings.

  [Project Gutenberg]: https://www.gutenberg.org

#### Extension: `sourcepos` ####

Include source position attributes when parsing `commonmark`.
For elements that accept attributes, a `data-pos` attribute
is added; other elements are placed in a surrounding
Div or Span element with a `data-pos` attribute.

#### Extension: `short_subsuperscripts` ####

Parse multimarkdown style subscripts and superscripts, which start with
a '~' or '^' character, respectively, and include the alphanumeric sequence
that follows. For example:

    x^2 = 4

or

    Oxygen is O~2.

#### Extension: `wikilinks_title_after_pipe` ####

Pandoc supports multiple markdown wikilink syntaxes, regardless of
whether the title is before or after the pipe.

Using `--from=markdown+wikilinks_title_after_pipe` results in
```[[Wiki]]
[[URL|title]]
```

while using `--from=markdown+wikilinks_title_before_pipe` results
in
```[[Wiki]]
[[title|URL]]
```

## Markdown variants

In addition to pandoc's extended Markdown, the following Markdown
variants are supported:

- `markdown_phpextra` (PHP Markdown Extra)
- `markdown_github` (deprecated GitHub-Flavored Markdown)
- `markdown_mmd` (MultiMarkdown)
- `markdown_strict` (Markdown.pl)
- `commonmark` (CommonMark)
- `gfm` (Github-Flavored Markdown)
- `commonmark_x` (CommonMark with many pandoc extensions)

To see which extensions are supported for a given format,
and which are enabled by default, you can use the command

    pandoc --list-extensions=FORMAT

where `FORMAT` is replaced with the name of the format.

Note that the list of extensions for `commonmark`,
`gfm`, and `commonmark_x` are defined relative to default
commonmark.  So, for example, `backtick_code_blocks`
does not appear as an extension, since it is enabled by
default and cannot be disabled.
